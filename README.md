#DEPRECATED
Bedrock v.1.x is no longer actively developed - all support has moved to [Bedrock2](https://github.com/brettonw/Bedrock2).

The [bedrock deployment](https://bedrock.brettonw.com) continues to be a Bedrock 1.6 instance because Bag test suites use the site.

# Bedrock
Bedrock is a foundation for rapidly building microservices with client interactions.

## Requirements
* mongodb
* docker
* yuidoc
* uglifyjs#harmony
* gcc
* gnupg2
